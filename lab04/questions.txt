- SQLAlchemy makes database management a lot easier. It does some of the work that SQL does not do for you and can combine tables automatically. It has a good infrastructure to work with along with Python

- a model issues SQL queries under the hood of the program

- a view is a subset of a larger table that can be queried for information
